# vim-artesanal
A Vim colorscheme with light and dark variants originally based on Material Design (now strongly modified to my likings).

This is a **W**ork **I**n **P**rogress. Don't expect screenshots any time soon ;-)

Inspired by & built with [Colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate).
